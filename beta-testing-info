Beta Testing Information - 18 September 2025

Hey everyone,

CyberPup Alpha is now available for testing! It's an iOS and Android app that aims to make personal cybersecurity accessible to non-tech people. Think of it as "Duolingo for cybersecurity" - users get bite-sized lessons and can track their progress through a personal security health check.

What makes it different:

    Gamified approach with progress tracking

    Tailored instructions based on your actual devices

    Covers the essentials: password management, 2FA, device security, privacy settings

    Completely free (and will stay that way)

    Based on established guidelines like cyber.gov's personal security guides

Why I'm building it: Too many people feel overwhelmed by cybersecurity advice. My goal is to break it down into manageable, actionable steps that anyone can follow, regardless of technical background. Also, a lot of the "security" apps on mobile app store either don't help at all or only cover a small part of the problem, while costing money. This app requires more user intervention but makes an actual difference and covers all areas.

Looking for feedback on:

    User experience and app flow

    Content clarity and usefulness

    Any bugs or technical issues

    Whether this approach actually helps people improve their security

Thanks for considering it!
